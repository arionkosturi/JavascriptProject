      "summary": "General Motors (GM) has announced that it is lifting its full-year profit guidance, due to plans to reduce spending on new products and cut operating costs by an additional $1 billion by the end of next year. The automaker reported a net income of $2.6 billion for the second quarter, a 52% increase from the previous year, as revenue grew by 25%. GM’s more optimistic outlook is driven by stronger demand and higher pricing, as well as a focus on profitability rather than volume. The company plans to reducing capital investments and target an additional$1 billion in overhead and marketing costs, but this does not factor in the potential costs of a strike by the United Auto Workers union. Following the announcement, GM's shares rose by 0.4% to $39.45 in premarket trade. GM now expects full year net income to $9.3 billion, up from its previous forecast of $8.4 billion to $10.7 billion. However, potential challenges in China and the impact of agreements with LG Energy Solution may affect the company's future performance.",
